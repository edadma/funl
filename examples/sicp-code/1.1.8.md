1.1.8   Functions as Black-Box Abstractions
-------------------------------------------

alternative definition of `square`

    def square(x) = exp(double(ln(x)))
    
    def double(x) = x + x

definition of `sqrt` with helper functions declared inside the body of `sqrt`

    def square(x) = x * x

    def average(x, y) = (x + y) // 2

    def sqrt(x) =
        def good_enough(guess, x) = abs(square(guess) - x) < 0.001

        def improve(guess, x) = average(guess, x / guess)

        def sqrt_iter(guess, x) =
            if good_enough(guess, x) then guess
            else sqrt_iter(improve(guess, x), x)

        sqrt_iter(1, x)

revised definition of `sqrt` so that helper internal functions use the parameter `x` of `sqrt`

    def sqrt(x) =
        def good_enough(guess) = abs(square(guess) - x) < 0.001
    
        def improve(guess) = average(guess, x / guess)
    
        def sqrt_iter(guess) =
            if good_enough(guess) then guess
            else sqrt_iter(improve(guess))
    
        sqrt_iter(1)
